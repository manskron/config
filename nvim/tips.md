# Random tips

### Navigation
`zz` centers current line.
`zt` puts current line at the top.
`zb` puts current line at the bottom.

`<ctrl>+e` scrolls down, while keeping cursor on line (accepts a count.)
`<ctrl>+y` scrolls up, while keeping cursor on line(accepts a count.)

Search can be chained after `c`.
So if I want to change everything up until `snakes` in the line below,
I can do `c/snakes<CR>`

`I want to change up until the word snakes`

This also works backward with `?`.
